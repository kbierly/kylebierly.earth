        <div id="AboutText">
        <p>I graduated Cum Laude from Pomona College, the #1 ranked liberal arts college in the nation according to U.S. News, as a double major with degrees in Mathematics and English. I was the first student to do so.
        <p>
        I was introduced to the world of GIS as a farm intern with Butler Green Farms in 2019. For my internship project, I created the company's first geospatial network (via Pomona's Esri license) that mapped its crops, water systems, and honeybee colonies to optimize their produce tracking and management. 
        </p>
        <p>I since fell in love with and decided to pursue a career in GIS because it allows me to explore my passion for geography while leveraging my experience in data analysis with my communication skills to develop informative maps and extract pertinent insights from vast data sources. I have garnered experience with programs and languages such as Excel, R, Mathematica, PowerBI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, QGIS, and Esri suite products by working on GIS and statistics projects for school and public organizations like Bainbridge Island School District.</p>
        <p>
        In my free-time, I enjoy traveling the world; I recently traveled all over Brazil (I speak Portuguese) and plan on visiting Portugal next. I am also a filmmaker, an avid chess fan, and I played football in college.
